                <h2>Mission goals and overview</h2>
                <p>Launched on November 26, 2011, and landing on August 6, 2012, in Gale Crater, NASA’s Curiosity Rover is part of the Mars Science Laboratory mission. Unlike its predecessors, Curiosity is a car-sized, nuclear-powered rover designed to explore Mars in unprecedented detail. Its mission focuses on assessing Mars’ past and present habitability, studying climate and geology, and preparing for future human exploration.</p>
                <p>Curiosity’s advanced instruments allow it to analyze rocks, soil, and the atmosphere to determine whether Mars ever supported microbial life.</p>
                <p>Assess Past Habitability: Investigate ancient environments that may have been capable of supporting microbial life.</p>
                <p>Study Mars’ Climate and Geology: Analyze rock formations, soils, and atmospheric conditions to reconstruct the planet’s environmental history.</p>

                <h2>Launch and landing details</h2>
                <p>NASA’s Curiosity Rover was launched on November 26, 2011, from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station aboard an Atlas V 541 rocket. After an 8-month journey to Mars, Curiosity executed a precise and complex landing on August 6, 2012, in Gale Crater, a region chosen for its layered sedimentary rocks and potential signs of past water.</p>
                <p>The rover’s landing, famously known as the “Sky Crane” maneuver, involved a heat-shielded descent, parachute deployment, and a rocket-powered sky crane that gently lowered Curiosity onto the Martian surface. This innovative method allowed for a safe landing of the car-sized, 900-kg rover and set a new standard for future large-robot Mars missions.</p>

                <h2>Launch and landing details</h2>
                <p>Opportunity (MER-B) was launched on July 7, 2003, from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station aboard a Delta II 7925H rocket. After nearly seven months of interplanetary travel, the rover landed successfully on January 25, 2004, in Meridiani Planum, a flat plain near Mars’ equator chosen for its indications of ancient water.</p>
                <p>Opportunity’s landing employed the same innovative system used by its twin, Spirit: a protective aeroshell, parachutes, and airbags, allowing the rover to bounce safely across the Martian surface before coming to rest at its landing site. This precise and safe landing marked the beginning of one of NASA’s most remarkable and long-lived Mars missions.</p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
</header>
<p>The NASA Mars Rover Program has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of the Red Planet. Beginning with Sojourner, which landed in 1997 as part of the Mars Pathfinder mission, NASA set the stage for future rover exploration. The program continued with the Spirit and Opportunity rovers, which landed on Mars in 2004, followed by Curiosity in 2012, and Perseverance in 2021. These rovers have gathered invaluable data on Mars’ history, climate, and potential for life. The Spirit and Opportunity missions lasted far beyond their expected 90-day lifespans, with Opportunity operating for nearly 15 years. Curiosity, powered by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG), continues its journey on Mars, studying the geology of Gale Crater and searching for signs of ancient life. Perseverance, which landed in Jezero Crater in February 2021, is focused on collecting samples to be returned to Earth by future missions. These rovers have revealed crucial evidence of ancient water on Mars, detected organic molecules, and tested new technologies for future human exploration, paving the way for NASA’s long-term goals of sending astronauts to Mars.</p>
