    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
   <h3>What is the NASA Mars Rover Program?</h3>
   <p>The NASA Mars Rover Program is a series of robotic missions designed to explore the surface of Mars. The program’s primary objective is to study the planet’s geology, climate, and potential for past or present life. Rovers like Sojourner, Spirit, Opportunity, Curiosity, and Perseverance have provided invaluable scientific data to help us understand Mars’ history and its potential for future human exploration.</p>
   <h3>What are the main goals of the Mars Rover missions?</h3>
   <p>The primary goals of the Mars Rover missions are to: Investigate the geology and surface features of Mars. Search for evidence of water and conditions that could have supported life. Study Mars’ climate and weather patterns. Test new technologies for future human missions to Mars.</p>
<h3>What is the difference between the rovers?</h3>
<p>Each rover in the program has unique capabilities and scientific instruments, but they all share the goal of understanding Mars.Sojourner (1997) was the first successful Mars rover, demonstrating the viability of robotic exploration. Spirit and Opportunity (2004) were twin rovers focused on geological studies and evidence of past water. Opportunity far exceeded its mission lifespan, operating for nearly 15 years. Curiosity (2012) is a car-sized rover with advanced tools for studying Mars’ history of habitability and its environmental conditions. Perseverance (2021) is the most recent rover, focused on searching for signs of ancient life in Jezero Crater and collecting samples for future return missions.</p>
<h3>How do the rovers communicate with Earth?</h3>
<p>The rovers communicate with Earth via Mars orbiters or directly, using radio signals. The data sent back includes images, scientific measurements, and status reports. The communication system relies on high-gain antennas and sometimes uses relay satellites orbiting Mars to ensure consistent and reliable transmission.</p>
<h3>How are the rovers powered?</h3>
<p>Sojourner, Spirit, and Opportunity were powered by solar panels, which charged their batteries to operate during the day. Curiosity and Perseverance use nuclear power, specifically a Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG), which allows them to operate continuously, even during Martian winters when sunlight is limited.</p>
<h3>How long do the rovers last on Mars?</h3>
<p>The expected mission lifespan for most rovers is around 90 sols (Martian days). However, many of NASA’s rovers have far exceeded their initial mission timelines. For example, Opportunity operated for nearly 15 years, and Curiosity is still active after more than a decade on Mars.</p>
<h3>What have the rovers discovered on Mars?</h3>
<p>The rovers have made groundbreaking discoveries, including: Evidence of ancient water in the form of minerals and rocks altered by water. Detection of organic molecules, the building blocks for life. Geological features like river channels, craters, and volcanic rocks that tell the story of Mars’ past. Seasonal variations in methane, potentially linked to biological or geological processes. Detailed analysis of the atmosphere, radiation, and weather, supporting future human missions.</p>
<h3>How does NASA plan to bring Mars samples back to Earth?</h3>
<p>NASA, in partnership with the European Space Agency (ESA), is working on the Mars Sample Return mission. Perseverance is collecting samples that will eventually be stored in special containers. Future missions, possibly in the late 2020s or early 2030s, will send another rover to retrieve these samples, launch them into orbit around Mars, and return them to Earth for analysis.</p>
<h3>When will humans go to Mars?</h3>
<p>While no specific timeline has been set, NASA’s long-term goal is to send humans to Mars in the 2030s. The data gathered by the rovers, especially regarding Mars’ climate, radiation levels, and the planet’s ability to support life, will help inform the planning of future human missions.</p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
</header>
<p>The NASA Mars Rover Program has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of the Red Planet. Beginning with Sojourner, which landed in 1997 as part of the Mars Pathfinder mission, NASA set the stage for future rover exploration. The program continued with the Spirit and Opportunity rovers, which landed on Mars in 2004, followed by Curiosity in 2012, and Perseverance in 2021. These rovers have gathered invaluable data on Mars’ history, climate, and potential for life. The Spirit and Opportunity missions lasted far beyond their expected 90-day lifespans, with Opportunity operating for nearly 15 years. Curiosity, powered by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG), continues its journey on Mars, studying the geology of Gale Crater and searching for signs of ancient life. Perseverance, which landed in Jezero Crater in February 2021, is focused on collecting samples to be returned to Earth by future missions. These rovers have revealed crucial evidence of ancient water on Mars, detected organic molecules, and tested new technologies for future human exploration, paving the way for NASA’s long-term goals of sending astronauts to Mars.</p>
