            <h3>Mission goals and overview</h3>
                <p>Launched on November 26, 2011, and landing on August 6, 2012, in Gale Crater, NASA’s Curiosity Rover is part of the Mars Science Laboratory mission. Unlike its predecessors, Curiosity is a car-sized, nuclear-powered rover designed to explore Mars in unprecedented detail. Its mission focuses on assessing Mars’ past and present habitability, studying climate and geology, and preparing for future human exploration.</p>
                <p>Curiosity’s advanced instruments allow it to analyze rocks, soil, and the atmosphere to determine whether Mars ever supported microbial life.</p>
                <p>Assess Past Habitability: Investigate ancient environments that may have been capable of supporting microbial life.</p>
                <p>Study Mars’ Climate and Geology: Analyze rock formations, soils, and atmospheric conditions to reconstruct the planet’s environmental history.</p>
                <p>Search for Organic Molecules: Detect chemical ingredients essential for life.
                <p>Characterize Radiation and Surface Conditions: Collect data to support future human missions.</p>
                <p>Demonstrate Advanced Rover Technology: Test nuclear-powered mobility, autonomous navigation, and long-duration surface operations.</p>
            <h3>Launch and landing details</h3>
                <p>NASA’s Curiosity Rover was launched on November 26, 2011, from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station aboard an Atlas V 541 rocket. After an 8-month journey to Mars, Curiosity executed a precise and complex landing on August 6, 2012, in Gale Crater, a region chosen for its layered sedimentary rocks and potential signs of past water.</p>
                <p>The rover’s landing, famously known as the “Sky Crane” maneuver, involved a heat-shielded descent, parachute deployment, and a rocket-powered sky crane that gently lowered Curiosity onto the Martian surface. This innovative method allowed for a safe landing of the car-sized, 900-kg rover and set a new standard for future large-robot Mars missions.</p>
                
            <h3>Major discoveries and accomplishments</h3>
                <p>Evidence of Ancient Habitable Environments: Curiosity found rocks and sediments in Gale Crater indicating that Mars once had freshwater lakes and streams capable of supporting microbial life.</p>
                <p>Detection of Organic Molecules: The rover identified complex organic compounds in Martian rocks, key ingredients for life.</p>
                <p>Detailed Geological Insights: Curiosity’s analyses revealed the planet’s layered history, including volcanic activity, sedimentary deposition, and water alteration.</p>
                <p>Atmospheric and Radiation Studies: Measured Mars’ atmosphere and surface radiation, providing critical data for future human missions.</p>
                <p>Methane Fluctuations: Detected seasonal variations in methane levels, raising questions about potential biological or geological sources.</p>
                <p>Advanced Rover Technology Demonstrated: Nuclear-powered mobility, autonomous navigation, and long-term operations proved the feasibility of extended Mars exploration.</p>
                <p>Extensive Exploration: Curiosity has traveled over 30 kilometers (18.6 miles), climbing Mount Sharp and studying diverse terrains.</p>

            </figure>
            <h3>Mission goals and overview</h3>
           
                <p>Launched on July 7, 2003, as the twin of Spirit, Opportunity (MER-B) was part of NASA’s Mars Exploration Rover program. It landed on January 25, 2004, in Meridiani Planum, a plain near Mars’ equator, chosen for its signs of past water. Originally designed for a 90-sol mission, Opportunity far exceeded expectations, operating for nearly 15 years. Its achievements redefined our understanding of Mars as a planet shaped by water, wind, and volcanic activity, and demonstrated the incredible potential of robotic exploration.</p>

                <p>Demonstrate Long-Distance Rover Mobility: Test autonomous navigation and endurance across challenging terrain.</p>
            <h3>Launch and landing details</h3>
                <p>Opportunity (MER-B) was launched on July 7, 2003, from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station aboard a Delta II 7925H rocket. After nearly seven months of interplanetary travel, the rover landed successfully on January 25, 2004, in Meridiani Planum, a flat plain near Mars’ equator chosen for its indications of ancient water.</p>
                <p>Opportunity’s landing employed the same innovative system used by its twin, Spirit: a protective aeroshell, parachutes, and airbags, allowing the rover to bounce safely across the Martian surface before coming to rest at its landing site. This precise and safe landing marked the beginning of one of NASA’s most remarkable and long-lived Mars missions.</p>
            <h3>Major discoveries and accomplishments</h3>
                <p>Evidence of Past Water: Opportunity found hematite “blueberries” and sulfate-rich rocks, providing strong evidence that liquid water once existed on Mars.</p>
                <p>Extensive Exploration: The rover traveled over 45 kilometers (28 miles), far exceeding its original 600-meter mission goal.</p>
                <p>Geological Insights: Examined layered rocks and sedimentary formations, revealing Mars’ history of ancient wet environments.</p>
                <p>Long Mission Duration: Originally planned for 90 sols, Opportunity operated for nearly 15 years, making it one of the longest-lasting and most productive planetary rovers.</p>

            <h3>Launch and landing details</h3>
                <p>Spirit began its journey to Mars on June 10, 2003, lifting off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station aboard a Delta II 7925 launch vehicle. The rover was safely enclosed within its cruise stage and aeroshell, built to protect it during the long interplanetary trip.</p>
                <p>After traveling nearly seven months through space, Spirit made its dramatic arrival on January 4, 2004, touching down inside Gusev Crater—a site believed to have once held a vast ancient lake. Using a combination of parachutes, retrorockets, and protective airbags, Spirit bounced safely to rest at Columbia Memorial Station, named in honor of the Space Shuttle Columbia crew.</p>
            <h3>Major discoveries and accomplishments</h3>
                <p>Evidence of Past Water: Spirit found rocks altered by water, including hematite and sulfates, indicating that liquid water once existed in Gusev Crater.</p>

                <p>Power: Solar panels for recharging and radioisotope heaters for warmth.</p>
                <p>Communication: High and low-gain antennas for sending data to Earth via orbiters.</p>
                <p>Scientific Tools: Cameras, spectrometers, and a rock grinder to analyze Mars’ surface.</p>
                <p>Autonomy: Could navigate and avoid obstacles on its own.</p>
                <p>Longevity: Designed for 90 days but operated for over 2,200 days.</p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
</header>
<p>The NASA Mars Rover Program has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of the Red Planet. Beginning with Sojourner, which landed in 1997 as part of the Mars Pathfinder mission, NASA set the stage for future rover exploration. The program continued with the Spirit and Opportunity rovers, which landed on Mars in 2004, followed by Curiosity in 2012, and Perseverance in 2021. These rovers have gathered invaluable data on Mars’ history, climate, and potential for life. The Spirit and Opportunity missions lasted far beyond their expected 90-day lifespans, with Opportunity operating for nearly 15 years. Curiosity, powered by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG), continues its journey on Mars, studying the geology of Gale Crater and searching for signs of ancient life. Perseverance, which landed in Jezero Crater in February 2021, is focused on collecting samples to be returned to Earth by future missions. These rovers have revealed crucial evidence of ancient water on Mars, detected organic molecules, and tested new technologies for future human exploration, paving the way for NASA’s long-term goals of sending astronauts to Mars.</p>
