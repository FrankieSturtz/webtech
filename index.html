  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>Progressive enhancement is a paradigm that focuses on the core content of a webpage. The reason why we as creators make webpages is for the users to see the content we make. With progressive enhancement, it makes the process of web development easier to digest and allows us to make a great functional webpage with the user's experience in mind. Progressive enhancement is important in this day and age because it considers the user's needs. Without  using progressive enhancement, the user experience isn't considered and can lead to an unenjoyable experience for the user.</p>
  <p>Progressive enchantment also makes websites more accessible for all users. Whether it's using a different web browser, slower internet connection, or being on mobile, progressive enhancement allows for us as web developers, to build all our content in the right way. This process is something all web developers should consider when building a webpage. In the future, applying this foundation will make the overall work process easier and also makes a better final product.</p>

  <h2>Mars Rover Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
  <p>Some feedback that I received from my friends over my first draft helped me see some noticeable flaws and issues. When my first friend was looking through my first draft they pointed out on the Mars Rovers paragraph on the home page that the text was too small to read. This makes the information almost impossible to digest for the user. For my final draft I went through and added a simple fix to this and made the information presentable. Lastly, my other friend pointed out at the bottom of all tabs in my background information paragraph. That it would look much nicer if it were to be centered and a tad bit bigger in font size. I applied these changes to my webpage and made the overall design much more fleak.</p>
  <p>I had a fun time with this web development project. I never sat down and coded this much in one sitting in my entire life, even though it's something I thoroughly enjoy. I had some troubles with uploading files and copying the html file. But, sides for a couple of small things it wasn't all too difficult. This project taught me a ton when it comes to trial and error when coding. I had to just try and do the things I wanted done over and over again, until I found the fix. This was tedious at times, but overall the project was very enlightening. </p>
  <p>This whole class has been very exciting for me. I used to always play around with the inspect feature when I was younger but didn’t know much of anything before this class. I felt that I was able to learn a lot in a short amount of time and I feel somewhat proficient in my web development. I can apply these skills in the future by making websites for friends' businesses. I would recommend this class to my friends cause I feel you can learn a lot especially if they enjoy coding. If I were to do this class over again and fix some of my mistakes I would just not spend as much time staring at the error or problem and just play around with it. I felt that this process didn't fully click for me until I was able to fully understand what I was looking at. I think my skills improved thoroughly from the middle till now. I am very happy with my work in this course and I'm grateful to have the chance to be a part of this class!</p>
