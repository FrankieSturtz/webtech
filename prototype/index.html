</ol>
<p>Two Little Rock teams that do not compete in the Sun Belt are the women's swimming and diving team (Missouri Valley Conference) and wrestling (Pac-12 Conference), neither of which the Sun Belt sponsors.</p><p> Wrestling is the school's newest sport, starting in 2019, and is the first Division I program in Arkansas.</p>
